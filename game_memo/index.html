          Our memo game is a card game designed for single player. Cards are
          laid out in a grid face down randomly, and player take turns flipping
          pairs of cards over. On each turn, the player will first turn one card
          over, then a second. If the two cards match, the player scores one
          point, the two cards are removed from the game, and the player gets
          another turn. If they do not match, the cards are turned back over.
          The purpose is to match all pairs of cards as soon as possible. When
          cards are turned over, it is important to remember where they are for
          when the matching card is turned up later in the game. In this online
          version of memory, there are two levels of difficulty.
          <strong>Easy</strong> - eight unique pairs of cards, making 16 cards
          total. <strong>Hard</strong> - twelve unique pairs of cards, making 24
          cards total.
